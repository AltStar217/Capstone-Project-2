1. The "Alternative" Approach (Bold & Rebellious)
Best if you want to position yourselves as the agency that breaks the rules of boring templates.

Headline: The ALTernative to Average.

Sub-headline: We don't do templates. We don't do boring. We build digital experiences for brands that are tired of looking like everyone else.
2.Precision-engineered web design for brands ready to scale. At ALT, we focus on the pixels so you can focus on the profits.
4.Templates are for followers. We design for the leaders, the outliers, and the unapologetic. Your brand isn't basic; your website shouldn't be either.
3.The internet is crowded with noise. We build the signal. No shortcuts, no compromises—just high-octane design that makes your competitors look like they’re stuck in 2015.

Punchy Hook: Stop following the crowd. Switch to ALT.
